## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**
This prject is about extracting, transforming and loading data from online resources of movies databases to SQL database so that the user can analyze the data. After initial work, the next challenge was to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I have refactored the code from initial work to create one function that takes in the data from three resources (Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data) and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
